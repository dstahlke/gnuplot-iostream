Gnuplot-Iostream Interface
==========================

This interface allows gnuplot to be controlled from C++ and is designed to
be the lowest hanging fruit.  In other words, if you know how gnuplot works
it should only take 30 seconds to learn this library.  Basically it is just
an iostream pipe to gnuplot with some extra functions for pushing data
arrays and getting mouse clicks.  Data sources include STL containers (eg.
vector), Blitz++, Eigen, and armadillo.  You can use nested data types like
std::vector<std::vector<std::pair<double, double>>> (as well as even more
exotic types).  Support for custom data types is possible.

This is a low level interface, and usage involves manually sending commands
to gnuplot using the "<<" operator (so you need to know gnuplot syntax).
This is in my opinion the easiest way to do it if you are already
comfortable with using gnuplot.  If you would like a more high level interface
check out the gnuplot-cpp library (http://code.google.com/p/gnuplot-cpp).

Documentation is available at http://www.stahlke.org/dan/gnuplot-iostream
but also you can look at the example programs (starting with
"example-misc.cc").


Getting the source code
=======================

git clone https://github.com/dstahlke/gnuplot-iostream.git


Usage
=====

See the examples source code for a quick intro.  Documentation is at
the project home page http://www.stahlke.org/dan/gnuplot-iostream .
To build examples just type 'make'.  There is an option you can edit in the
Makefile to enable extra demos that require optional libraries.


Note for Windows users
======================

Windows support basically works, but there are some troubles.  For hints, see:
